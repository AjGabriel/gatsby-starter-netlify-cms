Hello, I just recently started studying GatsbyJS which is a site generator. Alongside with it, I came across Netlify where I could deploy the sites that I will be making. It's a very cool technology and creating WebSites have never been much easier. Now I am testing this NetlifyCMS and see how I could incorporate it with a blogsite.
